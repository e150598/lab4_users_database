## Mongo-CRUD


### What is Mongo-CRUD

Mongo-CRUD is a simple wrapper library for the Nodejs MongoDB drivers avaliable. The libarary traspeartly manages how connections are made to Mongo database and manages the creation and destruction of these connections. Aside from connection to the database the Mongo-CRUD also provides a simple to use interface for the following operations (*Hint: it's gonna be CRUD!*):

* **C**reating documents and Collections.
* **R**etrieving documents from MongoDB collections.
* **U**pdating documents with in MongoDB collections.
* **D**elete documents from MongoDB collections.


## Usage

### Installation
You can install mongo-crud using the npm tool with the following command.
```
npm install --save mongo-crud
```

### Connecting to MongoDB
Connecting to MongoDB should be done during the initialization stages of starting up your server application use the library in your project using the ```require``` module then call ```connect``` with a callback function as shown below.
```
var crud = require('mongo-crud');

crud.connect('mongodb://{host}:{port}/{database}', function(err) {
	if(err) throw err;
    // Start your application here!
});
```

The connect function only needs to be called once during the application initialization phase. Just ```require``` the module where ever else you may need it in your application and ```mongo-crud``` will know how to connect to your database.

## CRUD Operations

### **C**reate
The create operation saves any object passed as a document to the MongoDB collection specified in the call. If the collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it the first time you try saving a document to it. 

 * @param {string} collection The name of the target mongo collection.
 * @param {object} doc The document to be stored.
 * @param {function} callback The command result callback.

The following example shows how to store the object ```{foo: bar}``` to the collection **Foo**.
```
  mongo.create('Foo', {foo: bar}, function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // process the result here. 
  });

```

### **R**etrieve
The retrieve operation returns an array of objects from the specified collection that matches the criteria. The criteria parameter is optional. If omitted, the array will contain all the objects held in the specified collection. Read the [MongoDB documentation on Querying](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/query-documents/) to understand how to build complex search criteria.

 * @param {string} collection The name of the target mongo collection.
 * @param {object} criteria The match criteria for the mongo where clause.
 * @param {function} callback The command result callback.

The following snippet shows the different ways to retrieve documents.
```
  // Example 1
  mongo.retrieve('Foo', function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // result contains an array with all objects in the collection Foo
      
  });
  
  // Example 2
  mongo.retrieve('Foo', {foo: bar}, function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // result contains an array with all object with peroperty foo == bar in the collection Foo
      
  });

```

### **U**pdate
The update operation can only be defined upon a single object. This library does not facilitate bulk updates. To use the update feature it is recommended you retrieve the object you want to update, change the properties that need changing and finally pass the updated object to the function.

 * @param {string} collection The name of the target mongo collection.
 * @param {object} criteria The match criteria for the mongo where clause.
 * @param {function} callback The command result callback.

The following snippet shows how to update documents using the retrieve operation for matching.
```
  mongo.retrieve('Foo', {foo: bar}, function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // for each object returned perform set the property foo == block.
      for(var i = result.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      	var foo = result[i]; 
        foo.foo = 'block';
        
        // save the update.
        mongo.update(foo, function (err, result) {
        	// handle any errors here.
        });
      }
  });

```

### **D**elete
The syntax for the delete and retrieve operations are virtually the same. The difference is in the behaviours. Instead of returning to the callback an array of matching objects, the delete function actually removes matching objects from the collection *(Bloody crazy right!!)*

 * @param {string} collection The name of the target mongo collection.
 * @param {object} criteria The match criteria for the mongo where clause.
 * @param {function} callback The command result callback.

The following snippet shows the differnt ways to delete documents.
```
  // Example 1
  mongo.delete('Foo', function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // deletes all documents in the collection Foo
      
  });
  
  // Example 2
  mongo.delete('Foo', {foo: bar}, function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;
      
      // deletes all documents with peroperty foo == bar in the collection Foo
      
  });

```
